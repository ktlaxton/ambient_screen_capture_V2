# User Interface Design Goals

**Overall UX Vision**
The user experience should be simple and unobtrusive. The goal is a "set it and forget it" utility that gamers can configure quickly and then have it run seamlessly in the background. The interface should be clean, modern, and feel at home within a gaming setup (e.g., defaulting to a dark mode).

**Key Interaction Paradigms**
* A primary settings window for initial setup and effect selection.
* A system tray icon (on the Windows taskbar) for quick access to toggle the effects on and off without opening the full window.

**Core Screens and Views**
* **Main Control Panel:** A single screen that contains the master On/Off switch, the list of selectable effect styles, and the audio sensitivity slider.
* **Monitor Setup Screen:** A visual interface that shows the user's current monitor layout and allows them to select which secondary displays the effects should appear on.

**Accessibility**
* **Target:** WCAG AA. We should ensure the application is usable for people with disabilities, including sufficient color contrast and keyboard navigation in the settings UI.

**Branding**
* There are no defined branding guidelines at this time. The initial design should be clean and functional, fitting a typical "gamer" aesthetic with dark themes and sharp, readable fonts.

**Target Device and Platforms**
* **Target:** Windows Desktop Only
