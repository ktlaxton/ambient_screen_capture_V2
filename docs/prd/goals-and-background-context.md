# Goals and Background Context

**Goals**
* To create a more immersive gaming experience by utilizing secondary monitors.
* To provide a highly customizable ambient effects experience for the user.
* To ensure the application is high-performance and has a minimal impact on gaming.

**Background Context**
Many gamers have multi-monitor setups, but the secondary monitors often go unused during gameplay. This project aims to solve that by transforming them into an ambient, immersive extension of the game world. By intelligently combining real-time audio and video data, the application will create dynamic lighting and visual effects that synchronize with the on-screen action, without requiring complex, game-specific integrations.
