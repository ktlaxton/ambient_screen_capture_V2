# Requirements

**Functional Requirements**

* **FR1:** The system must capture the user's primary desktop audio mix in real-time.
* **FR2:** The system must capture the user's primary monitor's display visuals in real-time.
* **FR3:** The application must render visual effects on one or more user-selected secondary monitors.
* **FR4:** The motion, pulse, and intensity of the visual effects must be directly driven by the captured audio.
* **FR5:** The color palette of the visual effects must be directly driven by the captured screen visuals.
* **FR6:** The application must provide a user interface (UI) to manage its settings.
* **FR7:** The UI must allow a user to turn the ambient effects on and off.
* **FR8:** The UI must allow a user to select from a list of different visual effect styles.
* **FR9:** The UI must provide a control (e.g., a slider) to adjust the sensitivity of the effect's reaction to audio.

**Non-Functional Requirements**

* **NFR1:** The application must be compatible with Windows.
* **NFR2:** The processing and rendering of effects should have a minimal, near-imperceptible latency.
* **NFR3:** All visual animations must render smoothly, without stuttering or "jerkiness."
* **NFR4:** The application's background CPU and GPU usage must be highly optimized to prevent any negative impact on game performance.
