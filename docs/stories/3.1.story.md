# Story 3.1: Activate Main Control Panel

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the controls on the main panel to be fully functional,
**so that** I can control the ambient effects in real-time.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The 'Soft Glow' and 'Generative Visualizer' styles can be selected from the style selector and the change is reflected instantly.
2. The audio sensitivity slider is now functional and correctly adjusts the responsiveness of the visual effects.
3. The application correctly saves and applies the last used settings (style and sensitivity) when it is started.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.3 completion:
- **Effect Selection**: Strategy Pattern successfully implemented with IEffect interface and EffectFactory
- **Real-time Effect Switching**: SetCurrentEffect method added to IEffectsRenderingService for instant switching without service restart
- **MainViewModel Integration**: Effect selection fully functional with two-way data binding
- **UI Integration**: ComboBox properly bound to AvailableEffects and SelectedEffect properties

### Technology Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: C# 12.0 (.NET 8 SDK) - Primary development language
- **Framework**: WPF (.NET 8) - Core UI and application framework
- **Build Tool**: MSBuild via dotnet CLI
- **Unit Testing**: xUnit 2.8.0 for unit tests, Moq 4.20.70 for mocking dependencies

### Architectural Patterns Implementation
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **MVVM Pattern**: Strict MVVM separation must be enforced - maintain clean separation between View, ViewModel, and Services
- **Dependency Injection**: Services must be managed via DI - register ISettingsService in App.xaml.cs
- **Service Abstraction**: OS interactions must be abstracted into Services - file I/O should be in SettingsService

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/components.md]
- **Settings Service**: Responsibility - A utility to save and load the ApplicationSettings data model to a local file
- **The ViewModel**: Responsibility - The "brain" of the UI, holds application state and logic, communicating with core services
- **Data Processor**: Responsibility - To receive raw data and simplify it into "dominant color" and "audio intensity" values

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **ApplicationSettings**: Purpose - To store all user-configurable settings, allowing them to be saved to a file and loaded at startup
  - Key Attributes: IsEnabled (bool), SelectedEffectId (string), AudioSensitivity (float), SourceMonitorId (string), TargetMonitorIds (List<string>)
- **EffectStyle**: Purpose - To represent a single visual effect that a user can choose
  - Key Attributes: Id (string), Name (string), Description (string)

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Settings Service**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine/Services/SettingsService.cs`
- **Settings Service Interface**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine/Services/ISettingsService.cs`
- **Models**: ApplicationSettings already exists at `./AmbientEffectsEngine/Models/ApplicationSettings.cs`
- **ViewModels**: MainViewModel at `./AmbientEffectsEngine/ViewModels/MainViewModel.cs`
- **Unit Tests**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine.Tests/Services/SettingsServiceTests.cs`

### Technical Constraints
- **Platform Requirements**: .NET 8 runtime, Windows desktop application
- **File Storage**: Use JSON serialization for settings file storage
- **Settings Location**: Store settings in user's local application data folder
- **Performance**: Settings load/save operations should not block UI thread
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle file system errors and provide fallback to defaults

### Audio Sensitivity Integration Requirements
- **Integration Point**: AudioSensitivity must be passed to data processing services
- **Range Validation**: AudioSensitivity should be clamped to valid range (0.0 - 1.0)
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes should apply immediately without requiring service restart
- **Current Implementation**: MainViewModel already has AudioSensitivity property with proper binding

### Settings Persistence Strategy
- **File Format**: JSON for human-readable configuration
- **File Location**: %LOCALAPPDATA%\AmbientEffectsEngine\settings.json
- **Backup Strategy**: Create backup file before writing new settings
- **Default Settings**: Provide sensible defaults for first-run experience
- **Migration**: Consider future settings schema versioning

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Philosophy**: All new logic accompanied by tests, aiming for 80% code coverage
- **Framework**: xUnit for unit tests, Moq for mocking dependencies
- **Test Location**: Tests should follow established structure in AmbientEffectsEngine.Tests/Services
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Test settings serialization/deserialization with various data scenarios
  - Test file system error conditions and recovery
  - Test integration between MainViewModel and SettingsService
  - Mock file system operations for isolated unit testing

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-23
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
**Excellent implementation** that demonstrates senior-level architecture and design patterns. The Settings Persistence Service implementation follows SOLID principles with clean separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and robust testing. The integration with existing services is seamless and maintains the established MVVM architecture.

### Refactoring Performed
No refactoring was required. The implementation demonstrates:
- **Clean Architecture**: Proper dependency injection and service abstraction
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling with backup strategy and graceful degradation
- **Thread Safety**: Proper locking mechanisms for audio sensitivity updates
- **Testability**: Internal constructor pattern for isolated unit testing
- **Best Practices**: Async/await patterns, proper resource disposal, and JSON serialization

### Compliance Check
- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Excellent adherence to C# 12.0 and .NET 8 conventions
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Perfect alignment with established architecture patterns
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage with 10 passing unit tests covering all scenarios
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All three acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified

### Improvements Checklist
[All items were already handled correctly in the implementation]

- [x] Settings persistence with JSON storage implemented correctly
- [x] Audio sensitivity integration with real-time updates working
- [x] Application startup settings loading implemented
- [x] Dependency injection properly configured
- [x] Comprehensive error handling with backup strategy
- [x] Thread-safe operations implemented

### Security Review
**No security concerns identified.** The implementation:
- Uses secure file system operations with proper path handling
- Implements ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull for parameter validation
- Stores settings in appropriate user directory (%LOCALAPPDATA%)
- No sensitive data exposure or logging of credentials

### Performance Considerations
**Excellent performance characteristics:**
- Async file I/O operations prevent UI thread blocking
- Efficient JSON serialization with System.Text.Json
- Thread-safe audio sensitivity updates with minimal locking overhead
- Backup strategy adds negligible performance impact
- Settings load only on startup, save only on changes
