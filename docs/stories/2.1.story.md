# Story 2.1: Real-time Data Processor

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system,
**I want** to process the raw screen and audio data into a simple, usable format,
**so that** the rendering engine can easily consume it to create effects.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A data processing module is created that receives data from the Screen Capture Service (from Story 1.2).
2. The module analyzes the captured image and determines a single, dominant color in real-time.
3. The module receives data from the Audio Capture Service (from Story 1.3) and calculates a simple intensity value (e.g., a number from 0 to 100).
4. The resulting color and audio intensity values are made available to other parts of the application with minimal latency.

### Technology Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: C# 12.0 (.NET 8 SDK) - Primary development language
- **Framework**: WPF (.NET 8) - Core UI and application framework  
- **Screen Capture**: Windows.Graphics.Capture (Windows 10, v1803+) - Already implemented in Story 1.2
- **Audio Capture**: NAudio 2.2.1 - Already implemented in Story 1.3
- **Unit Testing**: xUnit 2.8.0 for unit tests, Moq 4.20.70 for mocking dependencies
- **Build Tool**: MSBuild via dotnet CLI

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **ProcessedData** (new model needed): Purpose: Store processed screen and audio data for effects engine consumption
  - Key Attributes: DominantColor (System.Drawing.Color), AudioIntensity (float 0.0-1.0), Timestamp (DateTime)

### Component Architecture  
[Source: architecture/components.md]
- **Data Processor**: Responsibility: To receive raw data and simplify it into "dominant color" and "audio intensity" values
- **Integration Points**: Must receive data from Capture Services (Screen & Audio) and provide processed data to Effects Engine & Renderer

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Service Interface**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine/Services/Processing/IDataProcessingService.cs`
- **Service Implementation**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine/Services/Processing/DataProcessingService.cs`
- **Data Model**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine/Models/ProcessedData.cs`
- **Unit Tests**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine.Tests/Services/Processing/DataProcessingServiceTests.cs`

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Style**: Use standard .NET code style analyzers built into Visual Studio
- **Naming**: Follow standard Microsoft C# Naming Conventions
- **Critical Rules**:
  - Strict MVVM separation must be enforced
  - Services must be managed via Dependency Injection
  - OS interactions must be abstracted into Services

### Architectural Patterns
[Source: architecture/architectural-and-design-patterns.md]
- **Singleton Pattern**: For core data processing service to ensure only one instance is running
- **MVVM Pattern**: Standard pattern for WPF, cleanly separating UI (View) from logic (ViewModel)
- **Strategy Pattern**: Foundation for selectable visual effects (will be used in future stories)

### Technical Constraints
- **Performance**: Real-time processing with minimal latency (AC: 4)
- **Platform Requirements**: 
  - .NET 8 runtime (established from previous stories)
  - Windows desktop application context
  - Integration with existing capture services from Stories 1.2 and 1.3
- **Threading**: Must handle multi-threaded processing safely for real-time performance
- **Resource Management**: Proper disposal of processing resources to prevent memory leaks
- **Color Processing**: Dominant color calculation must be efficient for real-time video processing
- **Audio Processing**: Intensity calculation must normalize various audio levels to consistent 0-100 scale

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Philosophy**: All new logic accompanied by tests, aiming for 80% code coverage
- **Framework**: xUnit for unit tests, Moq for mocking dependencies
- **Specific Requirements**: 
  - Mock screen and audio capture service dependencies for testing
  - Test service lifecycle (start/stop/dispose)
  - Test real-time processing algorithms for accuracy
  - Verify thread-safe data access patterns
  - Test event notification system performance
- **Test Location**: Tests should be created in AmbientEffectsEngine.Tests/Services/Processing with matching folder structure

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-21
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
Exceptional implementation demonstrating senior-level architectural design and engineering practices. The real-time data processing service exhibits excellent event-driven architecture, proper thread safety, comprehensive error handling, and sophisticated smoothing algorithms. The implementation strikes an excellent balance between performance and maintainability.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: AmbientEffectsEngine/Services/Processing/DataProcessingService.cs
  - **Change**: Added proper thread synchronization around smoothing collection operations
  - **Why**: Smoothing collections (_colorHistory, _audioHistory) were accessed from multiple threads without synchronization, creating potential race conditions
  - **How**: Protected SmoothColor() and SmoothAudioIntensity() methods with lock(_lock) to ensure thread-safe access to shared collections

- **File**: AmbientEffectsEngine/Models/ProcessedData.cs
  - **Change**: Added AudioIntensityPercent computed property
  - **Why**: Acceptance Criteria specified 0-100 scale, but implementation correctly uses 0.0-1.0 for normalization. Added helper property for UI display.
  - **How**: Computed property that multiplies AudioIntensity by 100 to provide percentage scale when needed

- **File**: AmbientEffectsEngine.Tests/Services/Processing/DataProcessingServiceTests.cs  
  - **Change**: Added test for AudioIntensityPercent property
  - **Why**: New functionality requires test coverage to maintain quality standards
  - **How**: Added test to verify 0.5f intensity returns 50.0f percentage

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ Exemplary adherence to Microsoft C# conventions and .NET patterns
- Project Structure: ✓ Perfect service architecture following established patterns (Services/Processing namespace)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Outstanding test coverage with 15 comprehensive unit tests covering all scenarios
