# Story 2.3: 'Generative Visualizer' Effect Style

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to choose a more complex, generative visual style, like a classic music visualizer,
**so that** I can have a more dynamic and visually interesting ambient experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new 'Generative Visualizer' effect is created that displays evolving, abstract, or fractal-like patterns.
2. The speed and complexity of the pattern's movement are controlled by the audio intensity from the Data Processor.
3. The color palette of the patterns is determined by the dominant screen color from the Data Processor.
4. The effect style selector in the UI (from Story 1.4) is now functional and allows switching between 'Soft Glow' and 'Generative Visualizer'.
5. The selected style is properly rendered on the secondary monitors.

- **Framework**: WPF (.NET 8) - Core UI and application framework
- **Graphics**: Windows Forms + GDI+ for effect rendering on secondary monitors
- **Unit Testing**: xUnit 2.8.0 for unit tests, Moq 4.20.70 for mocking dependencies
- **Build Tool**: MSBuild via dotnet CLI

### Architectural Patterns Implementation
[Source: architecture/architectural-and-design-patterns.md]
- **Strategy Pattern**: Required for selectable visual effects - this story implements the pattern
- **MVVM Pattern**: Continue using established MVVM structure with proper service integration
- **Singleton Pattern**: Maintain singleton pattern for effects rendering service

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/components.md]
- **Effects Engine & Renderer**: Extend existing implementation to support multiple effect types
- **Settings Service**: Integration required for persisting selected effect choice
- **The ViewModel**: Update MainViewModel to handle effect selection and management

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **EffectStyle**: Purpose: Represent single visual effect - Id (string), Name (string), Description (string)
- **ApplicationSettings**: Update to include SelectedEffectId (string) property
- **ProcessedData**: Continue using existing DominantColor and AudioIntensity properties

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Effect Interface**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine/Services/Rendering/Effects/IEffect.cs`
- **Generative Effect**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine/Services/Rendering/Effects/GenerativeVisualizerEffect.cs`
- **Effect Factory**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine/Services/Rendering/EffectFactory.cs`
- **Data Models**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine/Models/EffectStyle.cs`
- **Unit Tests**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine.Tests/Services/Rendering/Effects/`

### Technical Constraints
- **Performance**: Maintain smooth 60 FPS rendering for complex visualizations
- **Platform Requirements**: 
  - .NET 8 runtime (established from previous stories)
  - Windows desktop application with multi-monitor support
  - Integration with existing effects rendering service from Story 2.2
- **Threading**: Must handle complex animations safely with existing Windows Forms threading model
- **Resource Management**: Proper disposal of animation resources and rendering contexts
- **Backward Compatibility**: Must not break existing SoftGlow effect or service integration
- **Real-time Switching**: Effect changes must occur without service restart or visual interruption

### Generative Visualizer Design Requirements
- **Visual Style**: Abstract, evolving patterns (particles, fractals, or geometric animations)
- **Audio Reactivity**: Animation speed/complexity increases with audio intensity (0.0-1.0)
- **Color Integration**: Use dominant screen color as primary palette with complementary colors
- **Smooth Animation**: Consistent frame rate with proper timing for fluid motion
- **Scalability**: Must work across different monitor sizes and aspect ratios
- **Performance**: Efficient rendering without impacting game performance (non-functional requirement)

### UI Integration Requirements
From Story 1.4 completion:
- **Effect Selection ComboBox**: Currently placeholder, needs to become functional
- **MainViewModel**: Update AvailableEffects collection and SelectedEffect property
- **Real-time Updates**: Effect switching must work immediately without application restart
- **MVVM Compliance**: Follow established patterns with proper property binding

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Philosophy**: All new logic accompanied by tests, aiming for 80% code coverage
- **Framework**: xUnit for unit tests, Moq for mocking dependencies
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Test strategy pattern implementation and effect switching
  - Mock dependencies for isolated effect testing
  - Test complex animation logic with time-based assertions
  - Verify performance characteristics of generative visualizer
  - Test UI integration and real-time effect selection
- **Test Location**: Tests should follow established structure in AmbientEffectsEngine.Tests/Services/Rendering/Effects

### Performance Considerations
- **Animation Timing**: Use high-resolution timers for smooth 60 FPS animation
- **Memory Management**: Efficient particle/pattern generation without memory leaks
- **CPU Optimization**: Minimize computation overhead for real-time audio reaction
- **GPU Utilization**: Consider GDI+ optimization for complex drawing operations
- **Thread Management**: Maintain existing thread-safe patterns from SoftGlow implementation
