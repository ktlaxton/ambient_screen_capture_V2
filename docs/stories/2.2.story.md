# Story 2.2: 'Soft Glow' Effect Renderer

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to see a simple, ambient glow effect on my side monitors that reacts to my game,
**so that** my gaming experience feels more immersive.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The secondary monitors display a solid color.
2. The color displayed is the dominant color determined by the Data Processor (from Story 2.1).
3. The brightness/intensity of the glow is controlled by the audio intensity value from the Data Processor.
4. The On/Off switch (from Story 1.4) now correctly enables and disables this effect.
5. The effect is smooth and performs efficiently, as per the non-functional requirements.

- **Real-time Updates**: Must respond to ProcessedData events with minimal latency

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Philosophy**: All new logic accompanied by tests, aiming for 80% code coverage
- **Framework**: xUnit for unit tests, Moq for mocking dependencies
- **Specific Requirements**: 
  - Mock data processing service dependencies for testing
  - Test service lifecycle (start/stop/dispose)
  - Test monitor detection and management logic
  - Test effect rendering with various data inputs
  - Verify smooth transitions and performance characteristics
- **Test Location**: Tests should be created in AmbientEffectsEngine.Tests/Services/Rendering with matching folder structure

### UI Integration Requirements
From Story 1.4 completion:
- **MainViewModel Integration**: Must connect to IsEnabled property for effect toggle
- **Real-time Settings**: Must respond to settings changes immediately
