# Story 1.4: Basic Settings UI Shell

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to see the main control panel with all the settings components,
**so that** I can understand how I will control the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The main application window displays a settings panel.
2. The panel contains a master On/Off toggle switch.
3. The panel contains a placeholder for a dropdown/list to select effect styles.
4. The panel contains a slider for adjusting audio sensitivity.
5. The UI elements are laid out according to the high-level design, but do not need to be functional yet.

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [x] Create ApplicationSettings model in Models folder with required properties
  - [x] Create EffectStyle model for effect dropdown options

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.3 completion:
- **Technology Framework**: WPF (.NET 8) established and working well with proper DI integration
- **Project Structure**: MVVM architecture with Services/Capture/ folder structure proven successful
- **Dependency Injection**: Services managed via DI pattern with singleton lifetimes in App.xaml.cs
- **Testing Framework**: xUnit testing infrastructure in place with 30 tests passing
- **Service Pattern**: IServiceInterface + ServiceImplementation + comprehensive unit tests pattern established

### Technology Framework
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **UI Framework**: WPF (.NET 8) - Core UI and application framework
- **Language**: C# 12.0 (.NET 8 SDK)
- **MVVM Pattern**: Full MVVM support maintained per architecture requirements
- **Testing**: xUnit 2.8.0 for unit tests, WinAppDriver 1.2.1 for UI automation tests

### Architecture Patterns
[Source: architecture/architectural-and-design-patterns.md]
- **MVVM Pattern**: Standard pattern for WPF, cleanly separating UI (View) from logic (ViewModel)
- **Singleton Pattern**: Already established for capture services, continue pattern for ViewModels if needed

### UI Framework Decision Context
[Source: architecture/DECISION-UI-FRAMEWORK.md]
- **Framework Change**: Originally planned WinUI 3, switched to WPF (.NET 8) due to compatibility issues
- **MVVM Support**: Full MVVM pattern support maintained in WPF implementation
- **Build Stability**: WPF + .NET 8 builds successfully without runtime identifier issues
- **System Tray**: Windows Forms NotifyIcon integration already working with WPF

### Data Models Specifications
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **ApplicationSettings**: Purpose: Store all user-configurable settings for file persistence
  - Key Attributes: IsEnabled (bool), SelectedEffectId (string), AudioSensitivity (float), SourceMonitorId (string), TargetMonitorIds (List)
- **EffectStyle**: Purpose: Represent single visual effect for user selection
  - Key Attributes: Id (string), Name (string), Description (string)
- **DisplayMonitor**: Purpose: Store information about physical displays
  - Key Attributes: Id (string), Name (string), IsPrimary (bool)

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/components.md]
- **The View**: Visual part of application (UI) defined in XAML. Contains no logic.
- **The ViewModel**: "Brain" of the UI. Holds application state and logic, communicating with core services.
- **Settings Service**: Utility to save and load ApplicationSettings data model to local file (future integration)

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Models**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine/Models/ApplicationSettings.cs`, `EffectStyle.cs`, `DisplayMonitor.cs`
- **Views**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine/Views/MainWindow.xaml` (already exists, needs update)
- **ViewModels**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine/ViewModels/MainViewModel.cs` (needs creation)
- **Unit Tests**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine.Tests/ViewModels/MainViewModelTests.cs`
- **UI Tests**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine.Tests/Views/MainWindowTests.cs`

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Style**: Use standard .NET code style analyzers built into Visual Studio
- **Naming**: Follow standard Microsoft C# Naming Conventions
- **Critical Rules**: 
  - Strict MVVM separation must be enforced
  - Services must be managed via Dependency Injection
  - OS interactions must be abstracted into Services

### Current Project State
- MainWindow.xaml currently contains only placeholder TextBlock
- ViewModels directory exists but is empty
- Models directory exists but is empty
- DI container already configured in App.xaml.cs with capture services
- 30 tests currently passing (previous stories)

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Philosophy**: All new logic accompanied by tests, aiming for 80% code coverage
- **Unit Testing**: xUnit for unit tests, Moq for mocking dependencies
- **UI Testing**: WinAppDriver for automated end-to-end UI tests
- **Test Location**: Tests should be created in AmbientEffectsEngine.Tests with matching folder structure
- **Specific Requirements for this Story**: 
  - ViewModel property change notification tests
  - UI element creation and data binding tests
  - Model validation tests for data integrity

## Change Log
