- **Framework**: WPF (.NET 8) - Established foundation from previous stories
- **Language**: C# 12.0 (.NET 8 SDK)
- **Required NuGet Package**: NAudio 2.2.1 needs to be added to project dependencies

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Service Interface**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine/Services/Capture/IAudioCaptureService.cs`
- **Service Implementation**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine/Services/Capture/AudioCaptureService.cs`
- **Unit Tests**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine.Tests/Services/Capture/AudioCaptureServiceTests.cs`

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Use standard .NET code style analyzers
- Follow Microsoft C# Naming Conventions
- **Critical Rules**:
  - Strict MVVM separation must be enforced
  - Services must be managed via Dependency Injection
  - OS interactions must be abstracted into Services

### Technical Constraints
- **Performance**: Optimized for low CPU impact (AC: 2)
- **Platform Requirements**: 
  - .NET 8 runtime (established from previous stories)
  - Windows desktop application context
  - NAudio 2.2.1 library dependency
- **Threading**: Must handle multi-threaded access safely for data sharing (AC: 3)
- **Resource Management**: Proper disposal of audio capture resources to prevent memory leaks
- **Audio System**: Must capture system default audio output mix, not microphone input

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Philosophy**: All new logic accompanied by tests, aiming for 80% code coverage
- **Framework**: xUnit for unit tests, Moq for mocking dependencies
- **Specific Requirements**: 
  - Mock NAudio dependencies for testing
  - Test service lifecycle (start/stop/dispose)
  - Test error handling and recovery scenarios
  - Verify thread-safe data access patterns
  - Test audio level calculation accuracy
