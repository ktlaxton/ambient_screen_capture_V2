# Story 1.3: Audio Capture Service

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system,
**I want** to continuously capture the system's default audio output,
**so that** this audio data is available for the effects engine.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A background service is implemented that can capture the system's default audio output mix.
2. The audio capture process is optimized for low CPU impact.
3. The captured audio level/data is accessible within the application.
4. The service can be programmatically started and stopped.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create audio capture service interface and implementation (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Create IAudioCaptureService interface in Services/Capture folder
  - [ ] Implement AudioCaptureService using NAudio library
  - [ ] Add Start() and Stop() methods for programmatic control
  - [ ] Implement proper disposal pattern for resource cleanup
- [ ] Implement audio capture functionality (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Set up NAudio WasapiLoopbackCapture for system default audio output
  - [ ] Configure capture settings for optimal performance (low CPU impact)
  - [ ] Implement audio level calculation and data processing
  - [ ] Add error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Make captured audio data accessible to other services (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Design event-based notification system for audio levels/data
  - [ ] Implement thread-safe data sharing mechanism
  - [ ] Add audio metadata (volume level, frequency data, etc.)
  - [ ] Create data access methods for consumer services
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests
  - [ ] Test service initialization and disposal
  - [ ] Test start/stop functionality
  - [ ] Mock NAudio dependencies for testing
  - [ ] Test error handling scenarios
  - [ ] Test audio level calculation accuracy
- [ ] Integrate with dependency injection container
  - [ ] Register service with DI container in App.xaml.cs
  - [ ] Ensure singleton lifetime for audio capture service
  - [ ] Add service to application startup sequence

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 completion:
- **Technology Framework**: WPF (.NET 8) established and working well
- **Project Structure**: MVVM architecture with Services/Capture/ folder structure proven
- **Dependency Injection**: Services managed via DI pattern with singleton lifetimes
- **Testing Framework**: xUnit testing infrastructure in place with 14 tests passing
- **Service Pattern**: IServiceInterface + ServiceImplementation + comprehensive unit tests pattern established

### Technology Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Audio Capture Library**: NAudio 2.2.1 - Popular, robust, and feature-rich audio library for .NET
- **Framework**: WPF (.NET 8) - Established foundation from previous stories
- **Language**: C# 12.0 (.NET 8 SDK)
- **Required NuGet Package**: NAudio 2.2.1 needs to be added to project dependencies

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Service Interface**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine/Services/Capture/IAudioCaptureService.cs`
- **Service Implementation**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine/Services/Capture/AudioCaptureService.cs`
- **Unit Tests**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine.Tests/Services/Capture/AudioCaptureServiceTests.cs`

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Use standard .NET code style analyzers
- Follow Microsoft C# Naming Conventions
- **Critical Rules**:
  - Strict MVVM separation must be enforced
  - Services must be managed via Dependency Injection
  - OS interactions must be abstracted into Services

### Technical Constraints
- **Performance**: Optimized for low CPU impact (AC: 2)
- **Platform Requirements**: 
  - .NET 8 runtime (established from previous stories)
  - Windows desktop application context
  - NAudio 2.2.1 library dependency
- **Threading**: Must handle multi-threaded access safely for data sharing (AC: 3)
- **Resource Management**: Proper disposal of audio capture resources to prevent memory leaks
- **Audio System**: Must capture system default audio output mix, not microphone input

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Philosophy**: All new logic accompanied by tests, aiming for 80% code coverage
- **Framework**: xUnit for unit tests, Moq for mocking dependencies
- **Specific Requirements**: 
  - Mock NAudio dependencies for testing
  - Test service lifecycle (start/stop/dispose)
  - Test error handling and recovery scenarios
  - Verify thread-safe data access patterns
  - Test audio level calculation accuracy
