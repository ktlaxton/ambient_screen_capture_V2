# Story 1.2: Screen Capture Service

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system,
**I want** to continuously capture the visuals of the primary monitor in a highly efficient manner,
**so that** this visual data is available for the effects engine.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A background service is implemented that can capture the primary monitor's screen content.
2. The capture process is optimized for low latency and minimal GPU impact.
3. The captured data is accessible within the application for other services to use.
4. The service can be programmatically started and stopped.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create screen capture service interface and implementation (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Create IScreenCaptureService interface in Services folder
  - [ ] Implement ScreenCaptureService using Windows.Graphics.Capture API
  - [ ] Add Start() and Stop() methods for programmatic control
  - [ ] Implement proper disposal pattern for resource cleanup
- [ ] Implement screen capture functionality (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Set up Windows.Graphics.Capture session for primary monitor
  - [ ] Configure capture settings for optimal performance (low latency, minimal GPU impact)
  - [ ] Implement frame capture event handling
  - [ ] Add error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Make captured data accessible to other services (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Design event-based notification system for new frames
  - [ ] Implement thread-safe data sharing mechanism
  - [ ] Add frame metadata (timestamp, resolution, etc.)
  - [ ] Create data access methods for consumer services
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests
  - [ ] Test service initialization and disposal
  - [ ] Test start/stop functionality
  - [ ] Mock Windows.Graphics.Capture for testing
  - [ ] Test error handling scenarios
- [ ] Integrate with dependency injection container
  - [ ] Register service with DI container in App.xaml.cs
  - [ ] Ensure singleton lifetime for capture service
  - [ ] Add service to application startup sequence

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 completion:
- **Technology Framework**: Successfully implemented WPF (.NET 8) instead of WinUI 3 for compatibility
- **Project Structure**: MVVM architecture established with proper Services folder structure
- **Dependency Injection**: Services managed via DI pattern established
- **Testing Framework**: xUnit testing infrastructure in place and verified working

### Technology Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Screen Capture API**: Windows.Graphics.Capture (Windows 10, v1803+) - Modern, high-performance, OS-level API for screen capture
- **Framework**: WPF (.NET 8) - Established foundation from Story 1.1
- **Language**: C# 12.0 (.NET 8 SDK)
- **Required NuGet Packages**: None additional - Windows.Graphics.Capture is part of Windows Runtime APIs accessible in .NET 8 desktop apps

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Service Interface**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine/Services/Capture/IScreenCaptureService.cs`
- **Service Implementation**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine/Services/Capture/ScreenCaptureService.cs`  
- **Unit Tests**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine.Tests/Services/Capture/ScreenCaptureServiceTests.cs`

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Use standard .NET code style analyzers
- Follow Microsoft C# Naming Conventions
- **Critical Rules**:
  - Strict MVVM separation must be enforced
  - Services must be managed via Dependency Injection
  - OS interactions must be abstracted into Services

### Technical Constraints
- **Performance**: Optimized for low latency and minimal GPU impact (AC: 2)
- **Platform Requirements**: 
  - Windows 10, version 1803+ (build 17134) or later required for Windows.Graphics.Capture API
  - .NET 8 runtime (established from Story 1.1)
  - Desktop application context (no UWP sandboxing restrictions)
- **Threading**: Must handle multi-threaded access safely for data sharing (AC: 3)
- **Resource Management**: Proper disposal of capture resources to prevent memory leaks
- **Permissions**: Application may require graphics capture permissions on some systems

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Philosophy**: All new logic accompanied by tests, aiming for 80% code coverage
- **Framework**: xUnit for unit tests, Moq for mocking dependencies
- **Specific Requirements**: 
  - Mock Windows.Graphics.Capture API interactions
  - Test service lifecycle (start/stop/dispose)
  - Test error handling and recovery scenarios
  - Verify thread-safe data access patterns
