# Story 3.2: Implement Monitor Selection

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user with multiple monitors,
**I want** to choose which of my secondary monitors will display the effects,
**so that** I have full control over my setup.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A 'Monitor Setup' screen is created.
2. The screen displays a visual representation of all connected monitors (e.g., boxes labeled 1, 2, 3).
3. The user's primary monitor is clearly identified and cannot be selected.
4. Users can select/deselect any of their secondary monitors using checkboxes or similar controls.
5. The ambient effects are only rendered on the selected secondary monitors.
6. The monitor selection is saved and persists between application restarts.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.1 completion:
- **Settings Persistence**: Excellent SettingsService implementation with JSON storage, backup strategy, and comprehensive error handling is available
- **MVVM Architecture**: Proper dependency injection and service abstraction patterns are established
- **ApplicationSettings Model**: Already includes TargetMonitorIds (List<string>) property ready for monitor selection storage
- **Thread Safety**: Proper locking mechanisms demonstrated for real-time updates

### Technology Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Language**: C# 12.0 (.NET 8 SDK) - Primary development language
- **Framework**: WPF (.NET 8) - Core UI and application framework
- **Build Tool**: MSBuild via dotnet CLI
- **Unit Testing**: xUnit 2.8.0 for unit tests, Moq 4.20.70 for mocking dependencies

### Architectural Patterns Implementation
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **MVVM Pattern**: Strict MVVM separation must be enforced - maintain clean separation between View, ViewModel, and Services
- **Dependency Injection**: Services must be managed via DI - register IMonitorDetectionService in App.xaml.cs
- **Service Abstraction**: OS interactions must be abstracted into Services - Windows API calls should be in MonitorDetectionService

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/components.md]
- **The View**: The visual part of the application (UI) defined in XAML. Contains no logic
- **The ViewModel**: The "brain" of the UI. It holds the application state and logic, communicating with the core services
- **Settings Service**: A utility to save and load the ApplicationSettings data model to a local file

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- **ApplicationSettings**: Purpose - To store all user-configurable settings, allowing them to be saved to a file and loaded at startup
  - Key Attributes: IsEnabled (bool), SelectedEffectId (string), AudioSensitivity (float), SourceMonitorId (string), TargetMonitorIds (List<string>)
- **DisplayMonitor**: Purpose - To store information about a single physical display connected to the user's computer
  - Key Attributes: Id (string), Name (string), IsPrimary (bool)

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Monitor Detection Service**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine/Services/IMonitorDetectionService.cs`
- **Monitor Detection Service Implementation**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine/Services/MonitorDetectionService.cs`
- **Monitor Setup View**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine/Views/MonitorSetupPage.xaml`
- **Monitor Setup ViewModel**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine/ViewModels/MonitorSetupViewModel.cs`
- **Models**: DisplayMonitor already exists at `./AmbientEffectsEngine/Models/DisplayMonitor.cs`
- **Unit Tests**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine.Tests/Services/MonitorDetectionServiceTests.cs`
- **ViewModel Tests**: `./AmbientEffectsEngine.Tests/ViewModels/MonitorSetupViewModelTests.cs`

### Technical Constraints
- **Platform Requirements**: .NET 8 runtime, Windows desktop application
- **Monitor Detection**: Use Windows API (User32.dll) for monitor enumeration
- **UI Responsiveness**: Monitor detection should not block UI thread
- **Dynamic Updates**: Handle monitor connect/disconnect events for real-time updates
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle API failures and provide fallback behavior

### Monitor Detection Integration Requirements
- **Windows API Integration**: Use EnumDisplayMonitors and GetMonitorInfo Win32 APIs
- **Real-time Updates**: Subscribe to WM_DISPLAYCHANGE messages for monitor configuration changes
- **Primary Monitor Detection**: Use GetSystemMetrics to identify primary display
- **Current Implementation**: ApplicationSettings.TargetMonitorIds already available for storage

### Effects Rendering Integration
- **Multi-Monitor Support**: Effects rendering service must support rendering to multiple specific monitors
- **Dynamic Selection**: Users should be able to change monitor selection without restarting effects
- **Performance**: Rendering to multiple monitors should not significantly impact performance
- **Resource Management**: Properly dispose of graphics resources when monitors are deselected

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Philosophy**: All new logic will be accompanied by tests, aiming for 80% code coverage
- **Framework**: xUnit for unit tests, Moq for mocking dependencies
- **Test Location**: Tests should follow established structure in AmbientEffectsEngine.Tests/Services and AmbientEffectsEngine.Tests/ViewModels
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Test monitor detection with various hardware configurations
  - Test UI interaction and selection validation
  - Test settings persistence and loading scenarios
  - Mock Windows API calls for isolated unit testing
  - Test effects rendering service integration with monitor selections
