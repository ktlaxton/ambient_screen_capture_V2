# Test Strategy and Standards
Philosophy: All new logic will be accompanied by tests, aiming for 80% code coverage.

Test Types: We will use xUnit for unit tests, Moq for mocking dependencies, and WinAppDriver for automated end-to-end UI tests.

Automation: All tests will be run automatically by the GitHub Actions pipeline on every commit.
