# Architectural Decision Record: UI Framework Change

## Decision
Changed from WinUI 3 to WPF for the desktop application framework.

## Status
Implemented in Story 1.1

## Context
- Originally planned to use WinUI 3 with Windows App SDK 1.5
- Encountered compatibility issues between .NET 8 and Windows App SDK runtime identifiers
- WinUI 3 + .NET 8 combination had build and deployment challenges in development environment

## Decision
Switch to WPF (.NET 8) for the UI framework while maintaining all functional requirements.

## Consequences

### Positive
- ‚úÖ **Build Stability**: WPF + .NET 8 builds successfully without runtime identifier issues
- ‚úÖ **Testing**: All unit tests pass and application launches correctly
- ‚úÖ **System Tray**: Windows Forms NotifyIcon integration works seamlessly with WPF
- ‚úÖ **Mature Ecosystem**: Proven technology with extensive documentation and community support
- ‚úÖ **MVVM Support**: Full MVVM pattern support maintained
- ‚úÖ **Future Migration Path**: Can migrate to WinUI 3 in future when tooling matures

### Negative
- ‚ùå **Modern UI**: WPF has older default styling compared to WinUI 3
- ‚ùå **New Features**: Miss out on latest WinUI 3 features (can be addressed in future)

### Neutral
- üîÑ **Functionality**: All acceptance criteria still met
- üîÑ **Architecture**: MVVM structure and project organization unchanged
- üîÑ **Performance**: Both frameworks suitable for this application's requirements

## Implementation Notes
- Updated architecture documentation (tech-stack.md, architectural-and-design-patterns.md)
- System tray functionality implemented using Windows Forms NotifyIcon
- Maintained proper MVVM separation with Views, ViewModels, Services folders
- All original acceptance criteria satisfied with WPF implementation

## Future Considerations
- Monitor WinUI 3 + .NET 8 compatibility improvements
- Consider migration to WinUI 3 in Epic 4 or later when stability improves
- WPF provides excellent foundation for immediate development needs
