# Architectural and Design Patterns

**Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM):** The standard pattern for WinUI 3, cleanly separating UI (View) from logic (ViewModel).

**Singleton Pattern:** For core Screen Capture and Audio Capture services to ensure only one instance is running.

**Strategy Pattern:** For selectable visual effects, allowing new effects to be added easily.
