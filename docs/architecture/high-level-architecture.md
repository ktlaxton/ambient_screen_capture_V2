# High Level Architecture

**Technical Summary**
This project will be architected as a monolithic Windows desktop application using the standard Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern to ensure a clean separation between the user interface and the core logic. It will feature background services for efficient, real-time screen and audio capture. A central processing module will analyze this data to drive a flexible rendering engine, which will use a "strategy" pattern to allow for easy selection and addition of new visual effects.

**High Level Overview**
* **Architectural Style:** Monolith. The application will be a single, self-contained executable.
* **Repository Structure:** Monorepo. All code for the application will reside in a single repository.
