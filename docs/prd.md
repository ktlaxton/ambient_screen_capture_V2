# Ambient Effects Engine Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### 1. Goals and Background Context

**Goals**
* To create a more immersive gaming experience by utilizing secondary monitors.
* To provide a highly customizable ambient effects experience for the user.
* To ensure the application is high-performance and has a minimal impact on gaming.

**Background Context**
Many gamers have multi-monitor setups, but the secondary monitors often go unused during gameplay. This project aims to solve that by transforming them into an ambient, immersive extension of the game world. By intelligently combining real-time audio and video data, the application will create dynamic lighting and visual effects that synchronize with the on-screen action, without requiring complex, game-specific integrations.

### 2. Requirements

**Functional Requirements**

* **FR1:** The system must capture the user's primary desktop audio mix in real-time.
* **FR2:** The system must capture the user's primary monitor's display visuals in real-time.
* **FR3:** The application must render visual effects on one or more user-selected secondary monitors.
* **FR4:** The motion, pulse, and intensity of the visual effects must be directly driven by the captured audio.
* **FR5:** The color palette of the visual effects must be directly driven by the captured screen visuals.
* **FR6:** The application must provide a user interface (UI) to manage its settings.
* **FR7:** The UI must allow a user to turn the ambient effects on and off.
* **FR8:** The UI must allow a user to select from a list of different visual effect styles.
* **FR9:** The UI must provide a control (e.g., a slider) to adjust the sensitivity of the effect's reaction to audio.

**Non-Functional Requirements**

* **NFR1:** The application must be compatible with Windows.
* **NFR2:** The processing and rendering of effects should have a minimal, near-imperceptible latency.
* **NFR3:** All visual animations must render smoothly, without stuttering or "jerkiness."
* **NFR4:** The application's background CPU and GPU usage must be highly optimized to prevent any negative impact on game performance.

### 3. User Interface Design Goals

**Overall UX Vision**
The user experience should be simple and unobtrusive. The goal is a "set it and forget it" utility that gamers can configure quickly and then have it run seamlessly in the background. The interface should be clean, modern, and feel at home within a gaming setup (e.g., defaulting to a dark mode).

**Key Interaction Paradigms**
* A primary settings window for initial setup and effect selection.
* A system tray icon (on the Windows taskbar) for quick access to toggle the effects on and off without opening the full window.

**Core Screens and Views**
* **Main Control Panel:** A single screen that contains the master On/Off switch, the list of selectable effect styles, and the audio sensitivity slider.
* **Monitor Setup Screen:** A visual interface that shows the user's current monitor layout and allows them to select which secondary displays the effects should appear on.

**Accessibility**
* **Target:** WCAG AA. We should ensure the application is usable for people with disabilities, including sufficient color contrast and keyboard navigation in the settings UI.

**Branding**
* There are no defined branding guidelines at this time. The initial design should be clean and functional, fitting a typical "gamer" aesthetic with dark themes and sharp, readable fonts.

**Target Device and Platforms**
* **Target:** Windows Desktop Only

### 4. Technical Assumptions

* **Repository Structure:** Monorepo
* **Service Architecture:** Monolithic
* **Testing Requirements:** Full Testing Pyramid (Unit, Integration, and End-to-End tests)
* **Primary Technology:** C# with the WinUI 3 framework.

### 5. Epic List

* **Epic 1: Foundation & Core Services:** Establish the foundational Windows application, implement the core services for screen capture and audio monitoring, and create the basic UI shell.

### Epic 2: The Ambient Effects Engine

**Expanded Goal:** The objective of this epic is to implement the core logic that transforms the raw data from the capture services into a tangible visual experience. This involves processing the data, rendering the first visual effect, and establishing the framework for multiple, selectable effects. By the end of this epic, the application will be fully functional, delivering its primary value to the user.

* **Story 2.1: Real-time Data Processor**
    * **As a** system, **I want** to process the raw screen and audio data into a simple, usable format, **so that** the rendering engine can easily consume it to create effects.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1.  A data processing module is created that receives data from the Screen Capture Service (from Story 1.2).
        2.  The module analyzes the captured image and determines a single, dominant color in real-time.
        3.  The module receives data from the Audio Capture Service (from Story 1.3) and calculates a simple intensity value (e.g., a number from 0 to 100).
        4.  The resulting color and audio intensity values are made available to other parts of the application with minimal latency.
* **Story 2.2: 'Soft Glow' Effect Renderer**
    * **As a** user, **I want** to see a simple, ambient glow effect on my side monitors that reacts to my game, **so that** my gaming experience feels more immersive.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1.  The secondary monitors display a solid color.
        2.  The color displayed is the dominant color determined by the Data Processor (from Story 2.1).
        3.  The brightness/intensity of the glow is controlled by the audio intensity value from the Data Processor.
        4.  The On/Off switch (from Story 1.4) now correctly enables and disables this effect.
        5.  The effect is smooth and performs efficiently, as per the non-functional requirements.
* **Story 2.3: 'Generative Visualizer' Effect Style**
    * **As a** user, **I want** to choose a more complex, generative visual style, like a classic music visualizer, **so that** I can have a more dynamic and visually interesting ambient experience.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1.  A new 'Generative Visualizer' effect is created that displays evolving, abstract, or fractal-like patterns.
        2.  The speed and complexity of the pattern's movement are controlled by the audio intensity from the Data Processor.
        3.  The color palette of the patterns is determined by the dominant screen color from the Data Processor.
        4.  The effect style selector in the UI (from Story 1.4) is now functional and allows switching between 'Soft Glow' and 'Generative Visualizer'.
        5.  The selected style is properly rendered on the secondary monitors.

### Epic 3: User Customization & Settings

**Expanded Goal:** The objective of this epic is to fully implement the user-facing controls and settings, transforming the application from a functional engine into a polished, user-friendly utility. This includes activating all UI controls, adding the crucial monitor selection screen, and ensuring user preferences are saved between sessions.

* **Story 3.1: Activate Main Control Panel**
    * **As a** user, **I want** the controls on the main panel to be fully functional, **so that** I can control the ambient effects in real-time.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1.  The 'Soft Glow' and 'Generative Visualizer' styles can be selected from the style selector and the change is reflected instantly.
        2.  The audio sensitivity slider is now functional and correctly adjusts the responsiveness of the visual effects.
        3.  The application correctly saves and applies the last used settings (style and sensitivity) when it is started.
* **Story 3.2: Implement Monitor Selection**
    * **As a** user with multiple monitors, **I want** to choose which of my secondary monitors will display the effects, **so that** I have full control over my setup.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        1.  A 'Monitor Setup' screen is created.
        2.  The screen displays a visual representation of all connected monitors (e.g., boxes labeled 1, 2, 3).
        3.  The user's primary monitor is clearly identified and cannot be selected.
        4.  Users can select/deselect any of their secondary monitors using checkboxes or similar controls.
        5.  The ambient effects are only rendered on the selected secondary monitors.
        6.  The monitor selection is saved and persists between application restarts.
